# Cat-Clicker

This was a little mini-project given to me by Udacity.  It's a fully responsive, and if you click the picture of my cat you will notice the "Total Clicks" will increase.  It was a fun project as it was based off of everything I've learned so far.  I really had fun making this!

I'm using bootstrap to make the website responsive.  I find it easier, and faster to get a fully responsive website.
